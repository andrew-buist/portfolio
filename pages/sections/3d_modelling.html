            I have been routinely learning, practicing, and utilising Blender since 2017. In about 2020, I started a worldbuilding project I called "Balleborough": a fantasy world that evolved out of a D&D campaign developed by me and my friends. <br><br>
            
            In 2022, I started creating assets for this world: the planet, terrain, and buildings. This helped me gain additional experience with procedural shaders and geometry, as well as UV mapping. <br><br>
        
            In 2023, I began utilising the Godot game engine to make the world explorable - the buildings shown in the gallery above illustrate some of the assets I developed for this. I have a real fondness for older game design with lower-resolution textures and low poly models (Katamari Damacy, Myst, Chulip), and try to reflect this design style in my work.
